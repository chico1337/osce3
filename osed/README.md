### install-mona.sh

downloads all components necessary to install mona and prompts you to use an admin shell on the windows box to finish installation.

```

### attach-process.ps1

Credit to discord user @SilverStr for the inspiration! 

One-shot script to perform the following actions:
- start a given service (if `-service-name` is provided)
- start a given executable path (if `-path` is provided)
- start windbg and attach to the given process
- run windbg commands after attaching (if `-commands` is provided)
- restart a given service when windbg exits (if `-service-name` is provided)

The values for `-service-name`, `-process-name`, and `-path` are tab-completable.

```
.\attach-process.ps1 -service-name fastbackserver -process-name fastbackserver -commands '.load pykd; bp fastbackserver!recvfrom'
```

```
\\tsclient\shared\osed-scripts\attach-process.ps1 -service-name 'Sync Breeze Enterprise' -process-name syncbrs
```

```
 \\tsclient\share\osed-scripts\attach-process.ps1 -path C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe -process-name notepad                       
 ```

This script can be run inside a while loop for maximum laziness! Also, you can do things like `g` to start the process, followed by commands you'd like to run once the next break is hit. 

```
while ($true) {\\tsclient\shared\osed-scripts\attach-process.ps1 -process-name PROCESS_NAME -commands '.load pykd; bp SOME_ADDRESS; g; !exchain' ;}
```

Below, the process will load pykd, set a breakpoint (let's assume a pop-pop-ret gadget) and then resume execution. Once it hits the first access violation, it will run `!exchain` and then `g` to allow execution to proceed until it hits PPR gadget, after which it steps thrice using `p`, bringing EIP to the instruction directly following the pop-pop-ret. 

```
while ($true) {\\tsclient\shared\osed-scripts\attach-process.ps1 -process-name PROCESS_NAME -commands '.load pykd; bp PPR_ADDRESS; g; !exchain; g; p; p; p;' ;}
```
